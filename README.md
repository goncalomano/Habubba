# Habbuba's Porfolio!
This is a custom portfolio made exclusively for Habubba.\
In this guide you will find how to compile your code , and how the code is structured.

## Code Structure

COMPONENT DESCRIPTION\
`Socialbar `- the component that handles the functions and animations of the twitter and instagram buttons.\
you can add as many social links as you want using the <Link> compoenent\
\
`Introduction`- This is just the name you find at the top of the page.\
\
`AboutMe ` - Strip that says aboutme ( not the whole section)\

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
